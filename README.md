Best wallpaper changer for windows 

Every windows user wanted to have his own set of wallpapers, which change over time and puts a lot of effort using Image editors to get the right background for his desktop.

"Werity" is the application which doesn't just give you the power to have your own set of wallpapers which change at the pace you decide, but has a multitude of functionality like giving you the customizability to get the different effects on wallpapers and also the choice to have some thoughtful quotes which keep changing with wallpapers. It is designed for much greater functionality like updating itself with newer wallpapers and quotations , categorizing wallpapers so that you can get the wallpapers depending on your Mood

As you might have noticed by now "Werity" is inspired from "Variety" -- which works on Linux environment. The 'W' in "Werity" indicates the windows adaptation of the idea.
